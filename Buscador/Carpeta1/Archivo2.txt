S\u00e1nchez was the subject of a record association football transfer when he signed for Barcelona in 2011 in a transfer worth \u20ac37.5 million, becoming the most expensive Chilean player of all time. There, S\u00e1nchez won six trophies, including a La Liga title and a Copa del Rey. He then joined Arsenal in 2014 in a transfer worth \u00a331.7 million (\u20ac35 million), and won two FA Cups, the 2015 PFA Fans' Player of the Year, and was voted into the 2015 PFA Team of the Year. In 2018, he moved to league rivals Manchester United in a swap deal; he signed for Inter Milan a year later, and won a Serie A title and a Coppa Italia.\nS\u00e1nchez made his senior international debut for Chile in 2006 at age 18, and has since earned 152 caps, appearing in eight major tournaments and becoming both his country's most capped player and all-time top goalscorer. He led Chile to their first victory in a major tournament by winning the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica, scoring the winning penalty in the final; he captained the team to a repeat of this triumph at the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, winning the Golden Ball for Best Player.\n\n"<end>
