10<splittername>"S\u00e1bado Gigante (English translation: \"Giant Saturday\" or \"Gigantic Saturday\"; known officially as S\u00e1bado Gigante Internacional outside Chile) was a Spanish-language television program broadcast by Spanish International Network in the United States. It was also Univision's longest-running program and the longest-running television variety series in world television history. S\u00e1bado Gigante was an eclectic and frenetic mix of various contests, human-interest stories, and live entertainment. From its start in 1962, it was hosted by Chilean TV star Mario Kreutzberger under the stage name of Don Francisco. Rolando Barral and Pedro De Pool began serving as a co-hosts in 1986; that role was taken over by Javier Romero in 1991.\nThe three-hour program aired on Univision each Saturday night at 8:00 p.m. (7:00 p.m. from 1987 to 2001). A new episode was produced every week throughout the show's history, with no reruns and only rare pre-emptions due to special programming (most notably by Telet\u00f3n USA, an annual 24-hour telethon held each December, which Kreutzberger has hosted since its inception in 2012). On April 17, 2015, Univision announced that S\u00e1bado Gigante would end after 53 years, with its final episode (titled S\u00e1bado Gigante: Hasta Siempre; English translation: \"Giant Saturday: Farewell\" or \"Gigantic Saturday: Farewell\") airing on September 19, 2015. For the first time during the show's run, the final episode aired live in Chile, Mexico and the U.S. After the finale, Univision replaced it with a prerecorded Mexican show, Sabadazo, which premiered on October 30, 2010, on Televisa and September 2012 on Univision. It was later replaced with Cr\u00f3nicas de S\u00e1bado and Sal y Pimienta on Univision as Sabadazo was moved back to its original afternoon time slot (both shows were later replaced by 2-3 Liga MX football matches broadcast on the network under the name S\u00e1bado Futbolero broadcast during that league's season; Sabadazo was then cancelled in 2015)."
